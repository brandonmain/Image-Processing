# Image-Processing
This repository contains the folders for each project from my Image Processing class. The actual assignment descriptions will not be kept on here for legal reasons.

Though many of the processing techniques in this repository have already been written, I will be implementing my own versions of these funtions from scratch becuase it is what is asked of me by this class.

## Tools I'll be using:
OpenCV - for reading, wrinting, and displaying images.
